During my internship, I undertook a significant project involving the creation of a Power BI report titled "India COVID-19 Dashboard," which utilized GitHub as its primary data repository. This report served as a comprehensive analytical tool, offering profound insights into the evolving landscape of the pandemic in India. By meticulously sourcing and analyzing COVID-19 datasets from GitHub repositories, I curated a dynamic and visually engaging dashboard that facilitated in-depth exploration of key metrics such as infection rates, mortality trends, testing capacities, and vaccination progress across different regions of the country. Through interactive visualizations and trend analyses, the report provided stakeholders with actionable intelligence to guide decision-making processes and resource allocation efforts. The utilization of GitHub for project upload ensured seamless collaboration, version control, and data integrity throughout the internship project This Power BI report not only sharpened my data analysis and visualization skills but also made a tangible contribution to the ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by empowering stakeholders with valuable insights derived from reliable and accessible data sources.
